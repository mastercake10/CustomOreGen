# You can create generators as much as you want.
# Important: All generators should be named "generator1", "generator2", etc. 
# You can define the spawnrates of any block in the blocks-section.
# The spawnrates are in percent, for example 57.3 are 57,3%.
# All values together should be 100%. If all values together are higher or lower as 100, the plugin would'nt work correctly.
# The permissions are custom, so you can make a generator for VIPS, and give them the permission "oregen.vip".
# Are you finish with configuring? Just type /customoregen to reload the plugin!

# Note: If the Island's owner is offline, the cobblestone generator would be choose the first Generator-Config.

    # You can also define from what level the generator should be activated. Example: Leave all permissions empty and
    # only work with the island Level. The plugin would only consider the islandLevel then.
